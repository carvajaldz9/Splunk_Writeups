#  Splunk Writeups

## 1. Introduction to Splunk

**Splunk** is a powerful SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and log analysis platform that enables organizations to search, monitor, analyze, and visualize machine-generated data from various sources.  
It is widely used in cybersecurity for:

- Threat detection  
- Incident response  
- Compliance reporting  
- Operational intelligence  

Splunk indexes logs and events, allowing security teams to perform real-time searches, set up alerts, and generate dashboards for security monitoring.

## 2. Key Features of Splunk

- ⚡ **Real-time data ingestion & indexing**  
- 🔍 **Powerful Search Processing Language (SPL)**  
- 🚨 **Alerting & Monitoring** (for anomalies and threats)  
- 📊 **Dashboards & Visualizations** (for threat intelligence)  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning & Behavioral Analytics** (via Splunk MLTK)  
- 🌐 **Integration with Threat Intelligence Feeds** (e.g., VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX)  
- 📄 **Compliance Reporting** (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR)

## 3. Splunk Architecture

Splunk has three main components:

| **Component**     | **Description**                                                |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Forwarder`       | Collects logs from endpoints and forwards them to the indexer. |
| `Indexer`         | Stores and indexes the data for fast searching.                |
| `Search Head`     | Provides the UI for searching and analyzing data.              |

**Additional Components:**

- 🛠 **Deployment Server** – Manages configurations for forwarders  
- 🏋️ **Heavy Forwarder** – Pre-processes data before indexing  
- 🪶 **Universal Forwarder** – Lightweight agent for forwarding logs

## 4. Splunk Use Cases in Cybersecurity

### A. Threat Detection & Hunting

- Identify malware infections (e.g., ransomware, trojans)  
- Detect brute-force attacks (e.g., failed SSH/RDP logins)  
- Hunt for lateral movement (e.g., unusual SMB/NTLM activity)

### B. Incident Response & Forensics

- Investigate incidents (e.g., phishing, data exfiltration)  
- Track user behavior anomalies (e.g., privilege escalation)  
- Correlate logs across firewalls, endpoints, and cloud services

### C. Compliance & Auditing

- Generate reports for PCI-DSS, HIPAA, NIST, ISO 27001  
- Monitor access control violations  
- Track changes to critical files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`)

### D. Network Security Monitoring

- Detect port scans, DDoS attacks, and suspicious traffic  
- Analyze NetFlow, Zeek (Bro), and Suricata logs  
- Identify command-and-control (C2) beaconing

## 5. Best Practices Notes

- ✔ Normalize logs using **CIM (Common Information Model)**  
- ✔ Use **correlation searches** to detect multi-stage attacks  
- ✔ Leverage **threat intelligence** (e.g., TAXII feeds)  
- ✔ Set up **real-time alerts** for critical threats  
- ✔ Optimize searches (avoid `*` wildcards, use **indexed fields**)  
- ✔ Regularly review **dashboards** for trends and anomalies
