# Splunk_Writeups

1. Introduction to Splunk

Splunk is a powerful SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and log analysis platform that enables organizations to search, monitor, analyze, and visualize machine-generated data from various sources. It is widely used in cybersecurity for threat detection, incident response, compliance reporting, and operational intelligence.

Splunk indexes logs and events, allowing security teams to perform real-time searches, set up alerts, and generate dashboards for security monitoring.

2. Key Features of Splunk
Real-time data ingestion & indexing

Powerful Search Processing Language (SPL)

Alerting & Monitoring (for anomalies and threats)

Dashboards & Visualizations (for threat intelligence)

Machine Learning & Behavioral Analytics (via Splunk MLTK)

Integration with Threat Intelligence Feeds (e.g., VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX)

Compliance Reporting (for regulations like PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR)

3. Splunk Architecture
Splunk has three main components:

Component	Description
Forwarder	Collects logs from endpoints and forwards them to the indexer.
Indexer	Stores and indexes the data for fast searching.
Search Head	Provides the UI for searching and analyzing data.
Additional components:

Deployment Server (Manages configurations for forwarders)

Heavy Forwarder (Pre-processes data before indexing)

Universal Forwarder (Lightweight, just forwards logs)

4. Splunk Use Cases in Cybersecurity
A. Threat Detection & Hunting
Identifying malware infections (e.g., ransomware, trojans)

Detecting brute-force attacks (e.g., failed SSH/RDP logins)

Hunting for lateral movement (e.g., unusual SMB/NTLM activity)

B. Incident Response & Forensics
Investigating security incidents (e.g., phishing, data exfiltration)

Tracking user behavior anomalies (e.g., privilege escalation)

Correlating logs across firewalls, endpoints, and cloud services

C. Compliance & Auditing
Generating reports for PCI-DSS, HIPAA, NIST, ISO 27001

Monitoring access control violations

Tracking changes to critical files (e.g., /etc/passwd modifications)

D. Network Security Monitoring
Detecting port scans, DDoS attacks, and suspicious traffic

Analyzing NetFlow, Zeek (Bro), and Suricata logs

Identifying command-and-control (C2) beaconing


5. Best Pratices Notes

✔ Normalize logs (use CIM – Common Information Model)
✔ Use correlation searches to detect multi-stage attacks
✔ Leverage threat intelligence (e.g., TAXII feeds)
✔ Set up real-time alerts for critical threats
✔ Optimize searches (avoid * wildcards, use indexed fields)
✔ Regularly review dashboards for trends and anomalies
